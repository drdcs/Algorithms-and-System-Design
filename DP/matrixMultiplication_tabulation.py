Input: p[] = {40, 20, 30, 10, 30}   
Output: 26000  
There are 4 matrices of dimensions 40x20, 20x30, 30x10 and 10x30.
Let the input 4 matrices be A, B, C and D.  The minimum number of 
multiplications are obtained by putting parenthesis in following way
(A(BC))D --> 20*30*10 + 40*20*10 + 40*10*30

Output: 30000 
There are 4 matrices of dimensions 10x20, 20x30, 30x40 and 40x30. 
Let the input 4 matrices be A, B, C and D.  The minimum number of
